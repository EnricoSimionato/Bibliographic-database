        "abstract": "Drought is the first place in all the natural disasters in the world. It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.

They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!"

Great.

I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest \"souper\" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a \"treat\", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for \"my dog loved it\".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend."

Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, \"I love carrot juice!\" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response."

        "abstract": "As process variations become a significant problem in deep sub-micron technology, a shift from deterministic static timing analysis to statistical static timing analysis for high-performance circuit designs could reduce the excessive conservatism that is built into current timing design methods. We address the timing yield problem for sequential circuits and propose a statistical approach to handle it. We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results. In addition, the correlation between longest and shortest path delays is not significant.",

                    "I am not a fan of soy beans, but decided to try these black soy beans.  They are wonderful - kind of crisp, with a \"nutty\" flavor and very filling.  I put them in chili and bean soup - any dish that calls for beans.  Wonderful diet food too as they are almost 100% fiber.",
                    "First, a  small caution - I am not a fan of frequently eating soy products, too much soy has its own risks. That said, I love these beans! I believe eating them on occasion is OK, and sure beats a beanless life, lol.<br />I purchased these locally for making chili in anticipation of the weather getting cool (finally!). I re-started a low carb lifestyle in June and was sad to think I would never have beans in my chili again. These do not disappoint. These are a little firmer than what I am used to with kidney beans, but they were very good and tasted great in the chili. One thing - if you like a lot of beans in your chili, only open one can at a time and see how it goes. I opened two because I usually put two cans of kidney beans in, and one was plenty for a small batch. I saw the post about using them to make refried beans and I will definitely try that.<br />Also, I found a blog with a recipe to make CHOCOLATE CAKE with these beans! I am giving it a try this afternoon. It is at healthy indulgences dot net. That gal has killer healthy low carb recipes and promotes Amazon as well. Search on chocolate cake with a secret. ;-) After all, I have an extra open can now, and have been so good with my 1 net carb chili, I deserve some choccy!<br />My local health food store charges nearly $3 a can for these. I just ordered 12 of them on Amazon for half that with subscribe & save. I am a happy camper!",
                    "Hesitantly, I ordered these in a case (12 cans) on our 1st try. What a pleasant surprise! They are very tasty and the texture is great. My husband, a carnivore, can't tell the difference in his signature buffalo chili. They're now on auto-ship to our home every few months. A great swap-out for eating lower-carb.<br /><br />The texture is - as far as I can tell - identical to traditional black beans. The flavor is a little different (not worse) than traditional canned black beans, but when seasoning is added, I couldn't tell one bit of difference.<br /><br />Note: I didn't even think about this before ordering, but after receipt inspected the nutrition label and found that these black beans actually have more calories per serving than traditional black beans (Trader Joe's). It's not much of a difference (I'm still on the black soy bean bandwagon), but it's something to consider.<br /><br />Here are the side-by-side nutrition facts, soy compared to traditional canned black beans from Trader Joe's (serving size: 130g):<br />Calories:  120 (soy) - 100 (TJ's)<br />Total Fat:  6g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Saturated Fat:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Trans Fat:  0g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Cholesterol:  0mg (soy) - 0mg (TJ's)<br />Sodium:  30mg (soy) - 440mg (TJ's)<br />Potassium:  310mg (soy) - not provided (TJ's)<br />Total Carbohydrates:  8g (soy) - 19g (TJ's)<br />-Dietary Fiber:  7g (soy) - 4g (TJ's)<br />-Sugars:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Protein:  11g (soy) - 7g (TJ's)",
                    "I never knew low carb beans existed. I heated these with garlic, mild paprika and California chili powder blend, with a surprising result. No soy aftertaste. Now I am processing to create a bean dip; so far with success. I recommend these black soy beans to anyone counting carbs."

We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) -  this is a really great kit.  Used up all the nori last night, and will get some more, but this really is all you need to get started.  Couldn't be happier and have recommended it to friends.",

        "abstract": "Resource allocation for multi-tier web applications in virtualization environments is one of the most important problems in autonomous computing. On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines. Experimental results indicate that the controllers can improve CPU utilization and make the best tradeoff between resource utilization and performance for multi-tier web applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we are providing a solution for an efficient and up-to-date commuting planner for a public transport system used by masses. Here, we present design and implementation features of a proposed system to be used for planning a bus travel. This problem is relevant to a large metropolitan city, like New Delhi, where local bus service forms the life-line of the city. There are about 10,000 city buses running on 814 routes on Delhi\u2019s roads. Often, there are many ways to reach a destination and often, commuters, even locals, do not possess knowledge about most of these alternate routes. Also, buses do not adhere to their schedules due to heavy traffic.Thus it becomes very difficult to remember every possible way to reach a destination (considering that one may have to break one\u2019s journey and take another route to reach the destination). Proposed BUSTRAP [1] solution aims at providing fairly accurate information about optimal way to reach a particular destination. Though we have implemented BUSTRAP as an SMS service, it can easily beadapted for other services like IVRS, WAP etc. stating one\u2019s current location and desired destination. The system will provide optimal ways to reach that place by bus \u2013 telling exact bus routes and numbers to board/change according to the bus movement on the city roads at that time. We record location of buses at a few instances on the roads through sensors. Our system finds their current location and speculates future locations based on these real time records. We identify changeover points on a route according to which a route plan would be formed.",

She crumbled them into deserts, coffees, made pumpkin ravioli with it, baked amaretti apples and always praised their magical taste. Upon finally purchasing a box myself I was blown away by the hypnotic and addictive taste of marzipan in these little gems.<br /><br />Amaretti Cookies are packed as a pair, wrapped in wax paper with Italian writing and insignias, praising its originality. They are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight. The taste is strangely addictive, after having a few I couldn't stop thinking about them! I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one. They taste like the holidays, spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond. They flavor is royal and time stopping, on busy days, one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.<br /><br />Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee, tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with. They really grew on me, I think I am an addict to their taste now, no wonder Giada is so smitten with them!<br /><br />- Kasia S."

This paper presents FCLOS, a complete client\u2013server architecture explicitly designed for mOLAP. FCLOS founds on intelligent scheduling and compressed transmissions in order to become a query efficient, self-adaptive and scalable mOLAP information system. Scheduling exploits derivability between data cubes in order to group related queries and eventually reduce the necessary transmissions (broadcasts). Compression is achieved by the m-Dwarf, a novel, compressed data cube physical structure, which has no loss of semantic information and is explicitly designed for mobile applications. The superiority of FCLOS against state of the art systems is shown both experimentally and analytically.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of India as a global player in software development, IT, and call centre operations is one side of an information revolution that has also begun to impact on governance and development at a domestic level in areas such as e-governance, e-commerce and e-health. The state, private and civil sectors have invested in numerous initiatives throughout the length and breadth of India aimed at extending the benefits of the information revolution to rural and remote areas. These range from Reliance Infocom\u2019s roll out of low-cost mobile cellular phones, to numerous civil society based initiatives aimed at establishing affordable access to information and knowledge. The state continues to invest in ICTs for development \u2013 from its support for Village Public Telephones (VPTs) to its enabling the computerisation of land records such as the Bhoomi project in Karnataka. The state\u2019s recognition of the role played by private and civil society sectors in development marks a major and distinct change in attitude from one characterised by \u2018tolerance\u2019 at best for these sectors and belief in the self-sufficiency of a \u2018dirigiste\u2019 economy, to pragmatic accomodations with these sectors. This change is to some extent a reflection of post-SAP policies adopted by the state, best illustrated by its steady withdrawal of support from its welfare agenda.",

                            "I had purchased Eden's umeboshi because I'd long heard of its positive health benefits. I suffer from chronic heartburn, so I thought maybe these would help. Odd that something that initially tastes like pouring salt into your mouth could somehow benefit digestion, but it does actually help a bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that you discard your heartburn/antacid pills...but my stomach does seem to settle after eating one of these plums. The packaging is excellent, as always, and both packs arrived with not a spill in sight. I believe Eden did change its policy on the number of plums per package though, as I had quite a few in each pack...I'd say more than 20 per carton for sure. On top was a little wad of shiso leaves, which gave it a lot of visual appeal. The plums were moist but not lying in a lot of juice, which I liked b/c I'd had plums packed in the pickling juices, and they were extremely mushy and fell apart. These had a nice and firm skin, though you could tell the insides were a paste-like texture from the feel of them. Initially, you really can't taste anything other than the salt. Very, very salty...which is proper for this type of food. However, after a few days, I noticed the actual taste of the umeboshi and shiso. Those first few I pitted by hand and choked down as quickly as possible, but now I find myself leisurely sucking on the plum and savoring the flavors before extruding the pits. I don't eat more than one a day because of the salt content, and I don't really like it on rice, but it tastes fantastic on its own and is truly great on corn on the cob. Squeeze a little out and rub on the corn, and it gives it a sweet/sour taste that's a low cal substitute for the slathering of butter I previously used. As soon as this last pack is done, I definitely plan on buying more."

The reason I'm giving them a three star review is because of the packaging.  It arrived squished and leaking - despite the sealed plastic cartons and an additional sealed plastic bag, they had leaked through the box itself.  It is also hard to distinquish how many plums I got because they were so squashed together in the containers.  I've become an Umeboshi plum convert, but I'm going to try to find them at a local Asian store rather than ordering them online when they can get so battered and messy.",

                            "Somebody at Eden needs to package these differently...I opened up my shipment today and there was a big sticky purple puddle in the box.  I love this company and buy loads of their products but this particular product was a disappointment.  And to those people who say \"Dont review the shipping, review the product\" I'm not going to eat something that is leaking all over the place AND the packaging is part of the cost I'm paying for these. Why can't they come in a plastic tub that snaps/screws shut securely...the price on the item certainly justifies that."

Squeeze a little out and rub on the corn, and it gives it a sweet/sour taste that's a low cal substitute for the slathering of butter I previously used. As soon as this last pack is done, I definitely plan on buying more."

Odd that something that initially tastes like pouring salt into your mouth could somehow benefit digestion, but it does actually help a bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that you discard your heartburn/antacid pills...but my stomach does seem to settle after eating one of these plums. The packaging is excellent, as always, and both packs arrived with not a spill in sight. I believe Eden did change its policy on the number of plums per package though, as I had quite a few in each pack...I'd say more than 20 per carton for sure. On top was a little wad of shiso leaves, which gave it a lot of visual appeal. The plums were moist but not lying in a lot of juice, which I liked b/c I'd had plums packed in the pickling juices, and they were extremely mushy and fell apart. These had a nice and firm skin, though you could tell the insides were a paste-like texture from the feel of them. Initially, you really can't taste anything other than the salt. Very, very salty...which is proper for this type of food. However, after a few days, I noticed the actual taste of the umeboshi and shiso. Those first few I pitted by hand and choked down as quickly as possible, but now I find myself leisurely sucking on the plum and savoring the flavors before extruding the pits. I don't eat more than one a day because of the salt content, and I don't really like it on rice, but it tastes fantastic on its own and is truly great on corn on the cob.

On top was a little wad of shiso leaves, which gave it a lot of visual appeal. The plums were moist but not lying in a lot of juice, which I liked b/c I'd had plums packed in the pickling juices, and they were extremely mushy and fell apart. These had a nice and firm skin, though you could tell the insides were a paste-like texture from the feel of them. Initially, you really can't taste anything other than the salt. Very, very salty...which is proper for this type of food. However, after a few days, I noticed the actual taste of the umeboshi and shiso. Those first few I pitted by hand and choked down as quickly as possible, but now I find myself leisurely sucking on the plum and savoring the flavors before extruding the pits. I don't eat more than one a day because of the salt content, and I don't really like it on rice, but it tastes fantastic on its own and is truly great on corn on the cob. Squeeze a little out and rub on the corn, and it gives it a sweet/sour taste that's a low cal substitute for the slathering of butter I previously used. As soon as this last pack is done, I definitely plan on buying more."

Odd that something that initially tastes like pouring salt into your mouth could somehow benefit digestion, but it does actually help a bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that you discard your heartburn/antacid pills...but my stomach does seem to settle after eating one of these plums.

        "abstract": "The health care system in Sweden and many other countries is facing increasing costs. The major reason is the changing age distribution of the population with more elderly people in need of support. At the same time, health care systems are often very labor and staff intensive. In this paper, we focus on a staff planning problem arising in Sweden where people receive home care from the local authorities. The objective is to develop visiting schedules for care providers that incorporate some restrictions and soft objectives. Each visit has a particular task to be performed, for example: cleaning, washing, personal hygiene and/or nursing activities. Each staff member has skills and each client should, if possible, be visited by the same contact person. The operational situation is continuously changing and planning is done each day. We describe the development of a decision support system Laps Care to aid the planners. The system consists of a number of components including information data bases, maps, optimization routines, and report possibilities. We formulate the problem using a set partitioning model and, for a solution method, we make use of a repeated matching algorithm. The system is currently in operation at a number of home care organizations. We report on the practical impact of the system in the health care organization which was involved in the development. The savings are considerably in terms of saved planning time and in the quality of the routes, as well as the measured quality for the clients. Numerical experiments of the system are presented.",

Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word \"strong\" or \"dark\" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed!",

                            "Has the richest flavor. Other K-Cup brands taste really bad after you try this one. Flavor might vary a bit between batches, but they are all good and strong. It is a waste to prepare a \"large\" cup with this, since it can easily handle a \"large+small\", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)<br /><br />PS: Decaf is equally good."
